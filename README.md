# PostHog `site.ts` local development server

## app-dev-sever

Run `npx @posthog/app-dev-server` inside any folder with a `plugin.json`, and we'll do our best to spin up a local
app development environment.

### Site Apps

Currently only site apps are supported. See the [Pineapple Mode](https://github.com/PostHog/pineapple-mode-app)
example app for a working example.
